# Purpose: a script that creates 4 directories using an array

# NOTE: All is commented out, as I began running out of time
#       and wanted to keep a placeholder without running a wacky script. 

# define an array with 4 directories inside

# create 4 directories


# mkdir ~/201_Ops_Challenges/d0
# mkdir ~/201_Ops_Challenges/d1
# mkdir ~/201_Ops_Challenges/d2
# mkdir ~/201_Ops_Challenges/d3

# define an array 

#first_array=(d0 d1 d2 d3)



# reference an array, put files into matching directories

# $[first=array3]
