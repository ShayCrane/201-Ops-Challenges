# # Ops Challenge - System Information
# # Overview
# # Objectives
# Create a script thatâ€¦
# Uses lshw to display system 
# information to the screen about the following components:

# CPU:
#
# Product
# Vendor
# Physical ID
# Bus info
# Width
#
# # RAM:
#
# Description
# Physical ID
# Size
# Display adapter:
#
# Description
# Product
# Vendor
# Physical ID
# Bus info
# Width
# Clock
# Capabilities
# Configuration
# Resources
# 
# Network adapter
#
# Description
# Product
# Vendor
# Physical ID
# Bus info
# Logical name
# Version
# Serial
# Size
# Capacity
# Width
# Clock
# Capabilities
# Configuration
# Resources
#
# Uses grep to remove irrelevant information from the lshw output3
# Add text to the output clearly indicating which component (such as CPU, RAM, etc.) the script is returning information about
# Runs as Root; you may execute the shell script with sudo or as Root


# lshw -short - prints device tree w/hardware paths

# lshw -businfo - prints SCSI, USB, IDE, PCI device info
# ( -numeric = if you want to also print numeric ID's for PCI, USB)
 
# lshw -html = print in html format
# lshw -xml = print in xml format
# lshw -json = display device tree as JSON object

# lshw -sanitize = do not print sensitive info


# grep (Global Srch for Reg. Expression and Print Out)
# checks for pattern matches (ex. text, anything)
# Ex,: grep "eggs" muffin_recipe.tx
#   search query must be surrounded in:
#        single quotes - single word
#        double quotes - more than one word
#   returns list of all the lines in a file which match the query
#        the above script example will return "2 medium eggs"
#            instead of just "eggs"

# *****USING GREP TO FILTER CMD OUTPUT*****
# Ex.  ls | grep "Do"
#    returns a list of all files, folders starting with "Do"
#       ls first lists all files in the folder, then grep filters it

# ***RECURSIVE SEARCH USING GREP***
# search mult. files for particular query
# Ex.: grep -r "egg" recipies/
#       will search for "egg" in folder, "recipes"
#           and all files that include "egg", 
#                and all text that appears on the line that matches "egg" (or the term)


lshw grep 
# add text to output clearly indicating components (CPU, RAM, etc)
# run as Root; execute shell script with sudo or Root
